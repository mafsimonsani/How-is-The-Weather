Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

#### WC '17 Contest 1 J2 - How's the Weather?

you've settled for writing a program to conveniently convert temperatures measured in degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit instead.
You came across the following formula, which holds true given that F is a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit while C is that same temperature in degrees Celsius:
C = 5 / 9 * ( F - 32)

Given a value of C , which is an integer between -40 and 40 (inclusive), determine the corresponding value of F , so that you can express the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit for the Americans' benefit.

Input Specification

The first and only line of input consists of a single integer, C.

Output Specification

Output a single integer, the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit which is equivalent to C degrees Celsius.
